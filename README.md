# USStataes
A game in which you need to guess all 50 states of us
The US State Guesser game allows players to guess the names of all 50 US states. Using Python's Turtle graphics for the interactive map and Pandas for data handling, it tracks guessed states, displays results, and saves unguessed states to a CSV file when the player exits.
